# üß† Employee Attrition Prediction üöÄ

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data analysis, preprocessing, and model building, we aim to identify factors contributing to attrition and develop a predictive model that can help organizations proactively address employee retention. This project provides a self-contained environment for the entire machine learning pipeline, from data loading to model evaluation.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Data Loading:** Reads and loads employee attrition datasets using `pandas`.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Scales numerical features using `StandardScaler` to ensure no single feature dominates the model.
    - Encodes categorical features using `OneHotEncoder` to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
    - Encodes the target variable 'Attrition' using `LabelEncoder`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Model Building:** Selects and builds appropriate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for prediction.
- **Model Training:** Trains the selected model on preprocessed data using `sklearn`.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction:** Predicts employee attrition on new data using the trained model.
